# Ramone-Kemono-s-MMD-Drag-Ball
The most advanced Spore MMD dance mod to date (05-2023)

Credits of the motion and audio resources are in the files and is displayed in the mods. Big thanks to @I-am-thedragon for their wonderous work with all the graphical assets used the dance effects!

Note of usage:
- After using a dance, the camera will freeze in place, in order to reset the camera, go to paint mode and then go back to test drive.
- All of these dances, camera motions and dance effects are meant to be for when the creature hasn't moved while in the test drive mode(not even spinning around). So if you moved the creature, go to paint mode, and then test drive again.
